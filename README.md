GroupMembership-FirstContact
============================

This assignment made us to finish the missing functions and blocks in the code to get an idea of how group membership works. It makes use of a leader election algorithm to keep the view updated when a leader crashes. The original version provided is gsm1 and the following versions are based on this, adding new features and functions as specified in the instructions.This was also part of the distributed systems course at KTH.
